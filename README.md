Ludum Dare 2020 October entry

Done by @ivucica, @buckmeister and @pekiZG.

# Overview

You are trying to defend a citadel which spawns drones that mine crystals.
Drones can only move on a loop and execute a loop of tasks. You are being
invaded by enemies who attack you in waves.

## Unfinished

You are supposed to be able to set the drone tasks before each wave, but
not during a wave. Sadly, neither this nor enemies shooting nor a losing
condition have been finished.
